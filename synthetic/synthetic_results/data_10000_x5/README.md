## Uplift Modelling for Dataset with 5 Confounders
### Results:
`./train_result_x5.csv` is the training result and the comparison with baseline performance

`./valid_result_x5.csv` is the validation result and the comparison with baseline performance
### Notes:
Please navigate to the [notebook folder](../../../notebooks) to obtain the necessary notebooks: `0_ate_weighting.ipynb`, `1_feature_correlations_BNEstimator.ipynb` and `2_node_embeddings.ipynb`

### ðŸŽ¯ RoadMap
---
0. Running `0_ate_weighting.ipynb` to obtain causal weighting for each feature, expected output is `Synthetic_feats_ate.xlsx`.
---
1. Running `1_feature_correlations_BNEstimator.ipynb` to obtain nodes and edges from Bayesian Net, expected output is `synthetic_edge_index.csv`.
---
2. Running `2_node_embeddings.ipynb` to obtain node embeddings by DeepWalk and Node2Vec, expected output are `synthetic_deepwalk_10d.model` and `synthetic_Node2Vec_10d.model`.
---
3. Running `causal_embedding(10d)_ ate(6d)_ .ipynb` and `causal_embedding(10d)_ unweighted_.ipynb` in this repository to perform **Causal-weighted and Unweighted uplift modelling, respectively**.
