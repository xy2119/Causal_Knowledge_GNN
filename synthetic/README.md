This is the `Datasets`, `Notebooks` and `Results` for the `generate_data` with 5 confounders / 9 confounders / 20 confounders.

## Synthetic Experiments

The aim of incorporating synthetic data in the simulation process is to be able to provide an priori evidence of to the methodology. The synthetic datasets are generated through `causalml.dataset.simulate_nuisance_and_easy_treatment module` in Causalml, featured by nuisance components  and an easy treatment effect function.

Three synthetic datasets are generated with 5, 9 and 20 confounders, respectively. Please navigate to the `synthetic_datasets` folder to obtain the necessary datasets before running the notebooks.
